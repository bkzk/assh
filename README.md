ASSH automate the login process to servers. It uses gpg-agent to store passphrase to password database file. Thanks to GnuGPG agent there is no need to enter this passphrase and passwords to servers every time you connect remotely to the server. Once you enter the passphrase it is kept by gpg-agent in memory for a certain period of time. This tool allow you to remotely login to servers without asking for a password, execute command on single or multiple servers. It also supports some of OpenSSH features like port forwarding or proxy connection and others like port knocking.
